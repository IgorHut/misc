Sample recordings from k4a demo.

Ascii format, description of colums:

* frame #0
  * frame time expressed in microseconds (since the start of the epoche)
  * sequence of 32 joints in a single row, where each joint is represented as:
    * joint 0 confidence (0 = none, 1 = shady, 2 = ok)
    * joint 0 position expressed as decimal triplet: x, y, z
    * joint 0 orientation as quaternion quadruplet: x, y, z, w
    * joint 1 confidence (0 = none, 1 = shady, 2 = ok)
    * joint 1 position expressed as decimal triplet: x, y, z
    * joint 1 orientation as quaternion quadruplet: x, y, z, w
    * ...
    * joint 31 confidence (0 = none, 1 = shady, 2 = ok)
    * joint 31 position expressed as decimal triplet: x, y, z
    * joint 31 orientation as quaternion quadruplet: x, y, z, w
  * end of line marks end of frame
* frame #1
  * ... and so on
